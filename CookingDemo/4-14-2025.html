							<p>To be honest, I'm relieved that I dropped the Space Invaders Demo. After the first week, it wasn't even trying to be something 
								similar to Space Invaders, and I really didn't understand where I was going to begin with.
							</p>

							<p>With that experience, however, I've learned a lot, and I'll be applying it to this new demo to 
								test out how my ideal cooking system in a game looks like. To sum up what I learned:
							</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Ignore the game mechanics that aren't important to the identity/core of your game.</li>
								<li>Try to plan ahead to so you don't have to go back and change your code (it saves a LOT of time).</li>
								<li>Don't worry too much about game balancing, you can always save it for later.</li>
								<li>When you're making things, don't try to immediately tie it into everything else at the same time, that is to say, 
									work on one feature at a time.
								</li>
								<li>Don't plan too far ahead. You'll end up pressuring yourself to do those things, even if it doesn't make sense or if I don't want to.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>With these lessons, I decided to only work on a cooking demo, and literally nothing else. By that I mean 
								I only plan on adding things that will contribute towards implementing my cooking system. As such, systems 
								such as movement or combat will be completely unnecessary (for now). That way, I can focus fully on developing 
								the system and making sure that I can fully understand how it works and what it requires.
							</p>

							<p>To start off, I plan on working on the UI and basic inventory, since you <i>need</i> it to access your ingredients. I'll 
								specifically work on developing an IngredientSlot class, to show what ingredients the user has. </p>

							<p>That'll be it for today. I just wanted to explain why I'm moving on and what I plan to do now. Thank you, and have a good day/night!</p>
