							<h1>Small Update: A New Game Engine!</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I just wanted to update you all on my decision to move from Unity to Godot!</p>]

							<p>I originally started with Unity because I had a class in it. After dropping the Space Invaders project, 
								I had time to think about what game engine I'd want to use. I knew after watching more than a few videos 
								that Unity was definitely not the move. The corporation probably will do some scummy tactics to screw over 
								its users, and I did not want that.
							</p>

							<p>From there, I decided to look into free and open-source alternatives. I had a few requirements:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>It had a decently large community, meaning the forums and community itself are very active.</li>
								<li>It doesn't have an atrocious learning curve.</li>
								<li>I could program in C# or C++.</li>
								<li>The game engine has good 2D game development support.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>Knowing all of that, there really are only two options for me: MonoGame and Godot. Between those two, Godot is 
								by far the more appealing choice. From what I saw, it allows for much faster development since I didn't have to 
								worry about low-level resource management like what I saw in MonoGame. I also already had some very limited experience 
								with Godot's node system, so it was a no-brainer to choose it.
							</p>

							<p>To end it, I will say that I'll definitely be busier for the next month, since it's the last month of class, and 
								I got a lot tests to study for and a Blender project that's due soon. Though if I have free time, I will definitely 
								try and see what I can do in order to develop my Godot skills. Thank you for reading, and have a good day/night!
							</p>
