							<h1>Lunar New Year, and the Start of a Long Journey!</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Being Lunar New Year (As of writing this, it actually isn't, its 12:20 AM on 1/30, but its okay), I decided that now would be a good time to put my first blog(?) update.</p>
							<p>First of all: Lunar New Year! It's an important time of the year for me and my family, so I went to ISR and watched my sister perform!
								We went to dining hall to eat after that, but there was definitely something up with the food since both me and my sister had stomachaches.
								Anyways, I got to call and talk to my family, so I would say it was a really good Lunar New Year, even if I'm far away from home.
							</p>

							<p>Secondly: Progress on the game! Not even 2 days after I named this project spaceInvadersDemo did I decide to not make it (lol).
								I just found that I didn't really click with this game idea, that I didn't want to make it, so I didn't. 
							</p>

							<p>I decided to make my original game idea: which is a game similar to HoloCure or Vampire Survivors, with my own unique twist through a unique upgrade menu.
								To that end, I successfully set up the basics of the game:
								<ul>
									<li>A main menu with a start, settings, and close game button</li>
									<li>Working movement for both the player and the enemy</li>
									<li>The ability to pause the game</li>
									<li>An upgrade menu that closes once you choose an upgrade</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
								<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://youtu.be/EOfjYhRAq-w" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer;
								autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							</div>

							<!-- https://youtu.be/EOfjYhRAq-w -->

							<p>For my next things to do, I want to add:
								<ol>
									<li>A working settings menu with volume, resolution, and fullscreening</li>
									<li>Gaining exp from enemies</li>
									<li>Choosing a starting weapon</li>
									<li>Making more weapons than just my simple gun</li>
									<li>Leveling up, and choosing random upgrades</li>
								</ol>
							</p>

							<p>Thats it for now, really. I just wanted to make my first post and share my progress so I don't get demotivated. Thank you, have a good Lunar New Year, and I'm out!</p>
