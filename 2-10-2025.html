							<h1>A Small Update, And Big Events on the Horizon (For me)!</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>It's been almost 2 weeks since my last update, so I thought it would be good to post an update!</p>
							<p>In terms of IRL stuff, I've been going really slow and steady, as I wanted. 
								However, the first half of this week is gonna be torturous, since my Calculus II test is on the horizon 
								(metaphorically, it's actually Wednesday). I also got accepted as a James Scholar, so I got an extra project to do for a class of my choice. 
								I chose my Blender class, because honestly, I do NOT want to take extra work for my calculus, CS, game design, or gen-ed class. 
								I'll probably be a little busy working on that, so I won't have as much time to work on the game.
							</p>

							<p>Moving onto game progress, I'm really happy with the progress I made! In all, I was able to, from my previous list:
								<ol>
									<li><s>A working settings menu with volume, resolution, and fullscreening</s> - Done! Idk if it actually works, but it's there.</li>
									<li>Gaining exp from enemies - Not Done D:</li>
									<li><s>Choosing a starting weapon</s> - Done! I added a starting canvas to choose your starter weapon.</li>
									<li><s>Making more weapons than just my simple gun</s> - Done! I added a sword.</li>
									<li>Leveling up, and choosing random upgrades - Not Done D:</li>
								</ol>

								And, as a bonus, I also added:
								<ol>
									<li>Enemy Spawning</li>
									<li>A stopwatch-esque timer</li>
								</ol>

								Essentially, I made 24 invisible objects right outside of the player's camera that follow the 
								player's movements. Every 2 seconds, if possible, a random one or few will spawn a not-yet-determined 
								amount of enemies (I haven't done any game balancing yet). There's also a timer to see how much time 
								you've spent in this one run.
							</p>

							<p><i>Someday, I'll have my voice in these, but my dorm is pretty noisy.</i></p>

							<p>Throughout this process, I also learned a lot about debugging, and the issues that occur with the solutions I
								thought were flawless. Some of my bugs and their causes include:
								<ul>
									<li>My sword's hitbox being part of my player's hurtbox: because the sword was a child of my player, 
										and my player's health was determined by a OnTriggerStay2D in my player object itself, 2D triggers 
										that applied to my player also took effect with my sword.
									</li>
									<li>The melee attack would be constantly visible as a sword in front of the character, even when not attacking: 
										I just had to make my animation disable the sword's Sprite Renderer and Collider2D upon ending.
									</li>
									<li>When spawning enemies randomly right outside of the player's screen, they just spawned once 
										or woulnd't spawn at all: My coroutine only ran once since it ran upon start, and when before, the 
										running of my coroutine depended on a boolean that I didn't define (bools are false when unassigned in Unity).
									</li>
								</ul>
							</p>

							<p>I added a lot of fundamental parts of the game, and I also learned a lot within these 2 weeks. From bug fixing in class 
								(I was NOT locked in) to sitting in my chair, thinking of how to implement the start screen, I'm happy with myself. However, 
								the game obviously still isn't complete, and there's a lot of things I want to add. On my list right now are:
								<ol>
									<li>Adding a healthbar for the player (maybe enemies)</li>
									<li>Getting EXP from enemies</li>
									<li>Leveling up!</li>
								</ol>

								In the distant future, to keep me focused, I want to work on:
								<ol>
									<li>The 3rd weapon (magic)</li>
									<li>Creating/Spawning stronger enemies</li>
									<li>The upgrade system</li>
									<li>A leveling system (might be different from upgrades)</li>
								</ol>

								To elaborate more on why I put the upgrade and leveling systems as separate, I'm not exactly sure how I want to proceed 
								with character strengthening. I'm thinking about either a <i>Vampire Survivors/Holocure</i> type leveling system, or a 
								<i>Mann vs Machine</i> or <i>Deadlock</i> type shop/upgrade system, but I don't know which one is better right now.

							<!-- <p>For my next things to do, I want to add:
								<ol>
									<li>A working settings menu with volume, resolution, and fullscreening</li>
									<li>Gaining exp from enemies</li>
									<li>Choosing a starting weapon</li>
									<li>Making more weapons than just my simple gun</li>
									<li>Leveling up, and choosing random upgrades</li>
								</ol>
							</p> -->

							<p>All in all, this post turned out to be way wordier than I expected. However, I hope you enjoyed reading about 
								my progress, failures, and future goals. Thank you, and have a good day/night!</p>
