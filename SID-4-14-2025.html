							<p>It's been a while huh? A lot of stuff has happened, and to be honest, it does not feel like 4 weeks have gone by. I felt like 
								I really was just trying to survive my exams. Because of that, I took more and more time away from making this game, and 
								after a while, I realized that I lost passion. 
							</p>

							<p>There are a lot of reasons why I lost passion, but I would definitely say the biggest cause was 
								a lack of preparation on my part. I didn't understand what I was getting myself into, since I believed 
								that I could just code everything into existence. However navigating Unity's menus and getting used to all their 
								coding conventions and libraries was something I was not prepared for.
							</p>

							<p>As I progressed further into the project, I realized that I got too inundated with having to learn a whole new 
								system for each feature I wanted to implement. I was tired of it. So I decided to start something new.
							</p>

							<p>For more information about it, check out this <a href="CookingDemo\CookingDemo.html" target="_blank">link</a>.</p>

							<p>I know that only I am to blame for dropping this project, but in the end I'm alright with that, 
								as long as I learned something new. Thank you for reading this, and have a good day.</p>
