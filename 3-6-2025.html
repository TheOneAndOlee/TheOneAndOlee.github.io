							<p>It's been 3+ weeks since my last update, and since I'm feeling really good after my CS test, I decided to post an update!</p>
							<p>Honestly not much has happened IRL, but I did spend a lot of time with friends.
								As for the calculus test, I got a 84, and honestly, I'm pretty proud of myself.
								I've made progress from my previous calculus tests since I actually understand my mistakes (even if it doesn't make me happy.)
							</p>

							<p>As for stuff I've managed to do in Unity, I've added the following:
								<ol>
									<li><s>A healthbar</s> - Done! Instead of a healthbar, I chose to display health as a text (because it provides more visual clarity).</li>
									<li><s>Getting EXP from enemies</s> - Done! It took me a bit of debugging, but killing enemies does grant the player exp.</li>
									<li><s>Leveling up</s> - Done! I've added a rudimentary EXP curve that will definitely change, but exp logic itself has been added.</li>
								</ol>

								I also changed some other things, and currently, I'm working on adding an inventory system following this
								<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSR2vNOypvs6eIxvTu-rYjw2Eyw57nZrU">guide</a> from Night Run Studio. '
								
								Some other changes I made were:
								<ol>
									<li>Changing the font from the default to Lexend in the game.</li>
									<li>Added actual spawning logic that spawns more and more enemies as time passes.</li>
								</ol>
							</p>

							</video>

							<p>Since I've pretty much added the core mechanics of any survival game, I'll be moving forward with unique game mechanics. 
								I've got some work to do, especially in real life (another calculus test hooray!), but my future plans are:
								<ol>
									<li>Finish the inventory system</li>
									<li>From there, adding the crafting/forging system</li>
									<li>Add logic for enemies to drop items</li>
									<li>Get blueprints from leveling up (see below).</li>
								</ol>

								In the future, I still want to work on:
								<ol>
									<li>The 3rd weapon (magic)</li>
									<li>Creating/Spawning stronger enemies</li>
								</ol>

								To explain the blueprints system: I want the plyaers to be able to get blueprints or materials upon level up. 
								The blueprints allow players to unlock unique variants of their weapon, each bringing their own strengths or downsides. 
								For example, a halberd would give you a bigger swing and more damage, but a slower swing and attack speed.

								To implement this, I was also considering making it so that your weapon starts in a weaker form, so the sword would start as a stick, 
								and the bow, a slingshot.
							</p>

							<!-- <p>For my next things to do, I want to add:
								<ol>
									<li>A working settings menu with volume, resolution, and fullscreening</li>
									<li>Gaining exp from enemies</li>
									<li>Choosing a starting weapon</li>
									<li>Making more weapons than just my simple gun</li>
									<li>Leveling up, and choosing random upgrades</li>
								</ol>
							</p> -->

							<p>This post is gonna be way shorter than the previous one, mainly because it's 1:26 AM, and I desperately need to sleep for my 
								CS tutorial tomorrow at 9:30. Still, I hope I showed you my progress, and thank you!
							</p>
